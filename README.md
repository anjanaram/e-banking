# e-banking
First select the netbeans icon. When the file opens it displays the e-banking file I have created. Select the e-banking file which displays the server and client of e-banking. First open the server side of the project where the administrator will be opened and hence enter the user name (Admin) and password (Anjana). After that create an account if needed or you can directly move to the client side having your pin number(if you have already created). In this you can transfer money,withdraw or even view your account balance.
